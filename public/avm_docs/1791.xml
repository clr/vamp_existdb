    <rdf:li xml:lang='x-default'>&quot;The further on the edge, the hotter the intensity,&quot; sings Kenny Loggins in &quot;Danger Zone,&quot; a song made famous by the movie &quot;Top Gun.&quot; The same words ring true for young, cooler stars like our sun that live in the danger zones around scorching hot stars, called O-stars. The closer a young, maverick star happens to be to a super hot O-star, the more likely its burgeoning planets will be blasted into space.

This artist&#39;s concept illustrates the process in action. An O-star can be seen near the top right, just behind a young, cooler star and its swirling disk of planet-forming material. Disks like this one, called protoplanetary disks, are where planets are born. Gas and dust in a disk clumps together into tiny balls that sweep through the material, growing in size to eventually become full-grown planets.

The young star happens to lie within the &quot;danger zone&quot; around the O-star, which means that it is too close to the hot star to keep its disk. Radiation and winds from the O-star are boiling and blowing away the material, respectively. This process, called photoevaporation, takes anywhere from one hundred thousand to about one million years.  Without a disk, the young star will not be able to produce planets.

Our own Sun and its suite of planets might have grown up on the edge of an O-star&#39;s danger zone before migrating to its current, spacious home. However, we know that our young sun didn&#39;t linger for too long in any hazardous territory, or our planets, and life, wouldn&#39;t be here today.

NASA&#39;s Spitzer Space Telescope surveyed the danger zones around five O-stars in the Rosette nebula. It was able to determine that the zones are spheres with a radius of approximately 1.6 light-years, or 10 trillion miles.
